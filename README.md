# Modern CMake C++ Template

This is a simple, opinionated, CMake template for C++ development.

# Using the template

To use the template, clone or download the template source files to your local machine.
Navigate to the template root directory using a PowerShell prompt (Note future shells or
a python version may come at a later time).

Execute the following command

```
./.template/ConvertFrom-Template 'Project Name' ~/path/to/project
```

This will create the project "Project Name" in the `~/path/to/project` directory. Configure
and build instructions can be found in the resulting output.
